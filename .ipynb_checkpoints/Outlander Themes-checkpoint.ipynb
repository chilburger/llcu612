    "<b>About the Series</b><br>\n",
    "The first book in the eight-book series was published in 1991. The story follows Claire, a young British woman who finds herself thrown back in time (17th century Scotland) and captured by Scottish highlanders. The book series goes on to intertwine the fictional lives of Claire and her husband Jamie and real historical events such as the Jacobite Rising.\n",

    "<b>Themes</b>\n",
    "In March 2018, Diana Gabaldon wrote an <a href=\"http://www.dianagabaldon.com/resources/what-i-do/one-word-speaks-volumes/\"><i>One Word Speaks Volumes</i></a> article discussing the themes for each of her novels in the series. For each book, she sums up the theme in one word:<p> \n",
    "<b>Book 1: Love<br>\n",
    "Book 2: Marriage<br>\n",
    "Book 3: Identity<br>\n",
    "Book 4: Family<br>\n",

    "Book 6: Loyalty<br>\n",
    "Book 7: Nexus<br>\n",
    "Book 8: Forgiveness<br></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Text Mining and Analysis</b>\n",
    "Out of curiosity, we explored the eight novels using text mining and analysis tools to see if the themes Gabaldon describes in her article emerged.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Corpus Description</b>\n",
    "Each book has been separated and converted into individual text files. There are currently 8 texts in the series and each text contains between 29,000 and 50,000 words. The total count for all of the books is 3,245,008 words and 42,849 unique word forms. \n"
