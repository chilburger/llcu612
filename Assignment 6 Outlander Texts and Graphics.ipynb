    "\n",
    "For our corpus, we chose the <i>Outlander</i> series, written by Diana Gabaldon. The first book in the series was published in 1991. The story follows Claire, a young British woman who finds herself thrown back in time (17th century Scotland) and captured by Scottish highlanders. The book series goes on to intertwine the fictional lives of Claire and her husband Jamie and real historical events such as the Jacobite Rising. In March 2018, Diana Gabaldon wrote an <a href=\"http://www.dianagabaldon.com/resources/what-i-do/one-word-speaks-volumes/\">article</a> discussing the themes for each of her novels in the popular Outlander series. For each book, she sums of the theme in one word; Book 1 is love, Book 2 is Marriage, Book 3 is Identity, Book 4 is Family, Book 5 is Community, Book 6 is Loyalty, Book 7 is Nexus and Book 8 is Forgiveness. We will use topic modelling to each of the books to see if the themes that Gabaldon describe emerge in our analysis. Additionally, we will use topic modelling on the entire corpus to see what themes emerge for the entire series, a series which has famously avoided being categorized into one genre or another. Our corpus is already compiled. Each book has been separated and converted into individual text files. There are currently 8 texts in the series and each text contains between 29,000 and 50,000 words. The total count for all of the books is 3,245,008 words and 42,849 unique word forms. "
